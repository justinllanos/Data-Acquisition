# Template Project README

### ***THIS IS A TEMPLATE PROJECT***

This entire folder can be copied and renamed for each arduino in
the system. This is a PlatformIO project, please refer to the 
[exceptional PlatformIO documentation](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/what-is-platformio.html)
to understand how to get started.

The easiest way to get started is to use the [PlatformIO extension](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)
inside of VScode. This gives easy access to the command line tools
that PlatformIO provides.

### ***PLEASE UPDATE THIS README WHEN YOU USE THIS TEMPLATE FOR A NEW PROJECT.***
